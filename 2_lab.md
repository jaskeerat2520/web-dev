### 5 different CMS services



1.  Strapi.


going through the strapi documenation this would probably be the best for making a eccomerce site 
this is because of the amount of fetures that are included with it. While looking for a cms service I am looking for the "simplest" where I could add to the dataset from the site and retrieve data from the data using http api but their is so much thrown at you and I am not the biggest fan of their documenation


2. ghost

Again this more of a all in one solution. This would be more usefull if i wanted to make a complette app or an eccomerce site where I could manage memberships and have user anylitics but it seams more straight forward for the uses for the assignment. Also the web app is alot more user-freindly it makes more "sence"

3. Wordpress

Going through the wordpress site it appears to be more aimed at a different audience. I would assume that this is the most popular among people who arent programmers rather someone who wants a way to make the site using their design tools so i decided not to try this out.

4. Sanity

Sanity was the one that caught my eye mainly because of the free option where it would be hosted in real time. Also it provided examples on how to use it with 11ty.
Also The content Lake fetures look really helpfull





To expierment I am going to create a card with an image and some text from the CMS providers 


{% include "partials/sanitycard.njk" %}
### Sanity   

Unfortanatley I am unable to get the pictures here they are in _data/images 
But For the next assignment I am going to be using Sanity as my healess CMS provider For the followinf reasons. First of all it is the cheapest one that will be hosted remotely other options would require you to pay to host. Other Reasons I am going to use sanity is because in my option it also has the best way to change the schemas and datasets locally

Some of the different Challenges were simpally setting up all of the files
