Since the 2000s, the growth in data and advancements in Cloud Computing, Data Lakes, and Distributed Systems have made it possible to store, process, and analyze Big Data efficiently. \n\n \n\nHow are AI and Big Data working together to transform the way businesses make decisions, optimize resources, and enhance customer experiences across different industries? \n\n \n\nServices - United Parcel Service Logo United States Postal Service UPS \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n### Data and AI at UPS: \n\n \n\nORIAN (On-Road integrated Optimization and Navigation)  \n\nData from UPS vehicles such as speed, direction, braking and drive train performance.  \n\nThis data is used to configure a driver’s route, pickups, and drop-offs in real time. \n\nUPS started developing ORIAN in 2003 with the goal of layering predictive algorithms on top of the vehicle tracking systems that they had at the time  \n\nORIAN provides an optimize route for each of UPS’ 55,000 U.S. drivers based on the packages to be picked up and delivered on that day. \n\n### Data and AI at UnitedHealth Care:  \n\n \n\nUsing unstructured data such as recorded voices from calls. \n\nIn the past the calls were only recorded for complaint reasons now they can get information from these calls by converting the voice into text using “natural language processing” software  \n\n\n \n\n \n\n### Power of using Big Data and AI \n\n Te use of Big Data and AI would allow for data driven decisions that will help drive business Success in the future. By optimizing resource Allocation and further understanding of Customer needs.  "},{"title":"LAB 1","summary":"This is my lab 1. I discuss the tech I used and justify it","date":"2024-11-10","content":"### Lab 1\n\n### My Experience using SSG \n\n\nMy first time learning about Static Site Generation was last year during the CSS course. After the first Year at durham college where I learned vanilla js and html I decided to learn react. Where their was alot more freedom of how i wanted to structure the folder and I could make components that I could use almost anywhere in the project. Moving forward to the next year in the css Course I struggled because of how much more rigid using ejs was. In a way using an SSG was harder because React would let me know right away if a variable was spelt wrong or if i was importing an element wrong. An example could be a navigation bar where in react if I were to place a navigation bar into a page it would atomatically import it where this is not the case with an SSG. This sounds like a small incovience but I was able to be \"lazy\" with React but with SSG's I was not able to. So in the beginning their was a learning curve but now after using SSG's for some time now it feals pretty natural \n\n\n###  Three different template engines\n\n## Nunjucks \nsome of the pros of using numjucks are the built in filters esspecially being able to have conditinal fettures where in other language I would need to use js for that logic another filter that would be extremley useful is when working with arrays being able to slice, sort and, join. Template inheritance also looks extremley simple and because of how the rigid the folders are structured it makes it really organized. Some of the negatives are that because it has more feteares it may have a longer learning curve to get all of the value out of using it. Out of all the other options this is the most modular which makes it easier on bigger projects but I on a smaller project with less files other options could make more sence\n\n\n## Handle Bars\n\npros of this is being able to use partials for modularity and also the logic of the code is seperate and you would need to add the logic using helpers which is helpful it makes the ocde easier to read but it also this process is more complex then using nunjuck where I could just use a filter. Also another con is that it is harder to use partials in handleabrs needing to register partials where in nunjucks you are able to just add partials to a partials file\n\n## EJS\n\nsome of the pros of EJS are that it simple and barebone javascript. The documentation mentions \"No religiousness about how to organize things. No reinvention of iteration and control-flow. It's just plain JavaScript.\" This looks good for smaller projects with less files but with bigger projects requiring structure would help keep the project organized\n\n\n### lab 1\nAll things considered i will be using Nunjucks for my first assignment mainly because I uisng it so far it feels \"natural\" to me and it has the best method of including partials and layouts out of the other options \n\n\n\n\n### SSG\n\nAn SSG that I have been interensted in before is next.js. An advanage of it is that it is a react framework and I enjoy working with React. Routing in react is my favourite because I could manage part of it using next.js I would be able to restric access to certain parts of the project thier and using next.js I can use this while making a SSG.\n## Configuration\n\nthe only setting that I would think about changing would be changing the direcory names. Other than that I have   \"scripts\": {\n    \"test\": \"echo \\\"Error: no test specified\\\" && exit 1\",\n    \"start\": \"npx @11ty/eleventy --serve\"\n  },\n  so I am able to refresh the page anytime the file is saved \n\n\n### Front Matter\n\nUsing front matter is where stuff like meta data go such as the title but you are also able to store data that is used on the page here.\n\n\n\n### Resources\n\nhttps://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/\n\nhttps://ejs.co/\n\nhttps://www.npmjs.com/package/handlebars\n\nhttps://handlebarsjs.com/"},{"title":"LAB 2","summary":"this is a summary for Assignment 2 I discuss what cms services i chose and why","date":"2024-11-15","content":"\n### 5 different CMS services\n\n\n\n1.  Strapi.\n\n\ngoing through the strapi documenation this would probably be the best for making a eccomerce site \nthis is because of the amount of fetures that are included with it. While looking for a cms service I am looking for the \"simplest\" where I could add to the dataset from the site and retrieve data from the data using http api but their is so much thrown at you and I am not the biggest fan of their documenation\n\n\n2. ghost\n\nAgain this more of a all in one solution. This would be more usefull if i wanted to make a complette app or an eccomerce site where I could manage memberships and have user anylitics but it seams more straight forward for the uses for the assignment. Also the web app is alot more user-freindly it makes more \"sence\"\n\n3. Wordpress\n\nGoing through the wordpress site it appears to be more aimed at a different audience. I would assume that this is the most popular among people who arent programmers rather someone who wants a way to make the site using their design tools so i decided not to try this out.\n\n4. Sanity\n\nSanity was the one that caught my eye mainly because of the free option where it would be hosted in real time. Also it provided examples on how to use it with 11ty.\nAlso The content Lake fetures look really helpfull\n\n\n\n\n\nTo expierment I am going to create a card with an image and some text from the CMS providers \n\n\n{% include \"partials/sanitycard.njk\" %}\n### Sanity   \n\nUnfortanatley I am unable to get the pictures here they are in _data/images \nBut For the next assignment I am going to be using Sanity as my healess CMS provider For the followinf reasons. First of all it is the cheapest one that will be hosted remotely other options would require you to pay to host. Other Reasons I am going to use sanity is because in my option it also has the best way to change the schemas and datasets locally\n\nSome of the different Challenges were simpally setting up all of the files \n\n![My Local Image](sanitylab2.jpg)"}]));
